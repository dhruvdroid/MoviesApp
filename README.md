# Android MVVM Architecture (HILT)

Consist of three main layer (3 Project modules with dependency between them)
- Presentation - UI (Activity, Fragment, ViewModel, ViewModelFactory)
- Domain (Usecase)
- Data - Data source (Rest API, Local DB)

Architecture has no dependency injection library. All injections between layers are done manually using 'inversion of control' concept
